               Davis California is a city west of Sacremento, in Caliofrnia.  It is home to the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame, UC Davis, and known as the most bicycle friendly town in the US.  Interesting enough, Gen Z may find it unique that it is a city in Yolo County.  I spent time here recently with my Wife, two kids, minature dachshund with the goal to visit my sister + family and explore some national parks!

               Yosemite National Park is home of breathtaking landscape.  Where you can take on your wild side and climb Half Dome - a thrilling steep climb up a side of a mountain tha tis not for the amature, or capture incredible views at El Captain and the Tunne View.  Of course its not a day completed without dining at the Ahwahnee hotel

            <p>
               Lake Tahoe is a hidden gem.  Especially to those who live in the midwest!  My family and I spent a few days in Lake Tahoe at the William Kent Campground.  We spend our time lounging on a rock beach -oof need better sandles for rocks-, taking turns on our infatable Stand Up Paddleboard (SUP!) and devouring camp site pizzas and smores.  We also saw a black bear (that was brown) and our 3 year old can't stop talking about it.

            <p>
               The last leg of our journey was a weekend spent in San Dieago...Wait this is not AnchorMan - we spent our time in San Fransicso.  Meeting with relatives, remote colleages from Bayer, and overall enjoying the 65 degree weather.  A 30 degree difference from the summer heat waves in the central vally of California.  The top spot to visit in North San Fransico was the Palace of Fine Arts: Scenic + Iconic + Spacious.  Built in 1915 and has stood the test of time and politics.
